Challenge Exercise 2: 

Write a Python program that determines whether a given year is a leap year or not. 
Your program should meet the following requirements:

Input Handling:
Prompt the user to enter a year.
Ensure the input is a valid integer.

Leap Year Rules:
A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
However, it is not a leap year if it is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.

Output:
If the input year is a leap year, print: "<year> is a leap year."
If the input year is not a leap year, print: "<year> is not a leap year."
If the input is not a valid integer, print: "Please enter a valid integer year.‚Äù

Loop:
The program should continuously prompt the user for a year.

Tips:
Use a while loop to continuously prompt the user.
Use try-except or input validation methods to check if the input is an integer.
Define a function to determine if a year is a leap year for better code organization.
